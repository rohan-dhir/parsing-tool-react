# Parsing-Tool (React)

### Overview
A remake of an older [project](https://github.com/rohan-dhir/TitleParser-App) that was previously developed with Java. This app is designed to remove extraneous details from text input. 

An ideal tool for an e-commerce website with long titles which include heavily descriptive text that may be better suited in the description.

The app works by comparing the user inputted text to a database of known product titles and parsing away extraneous details that are not included in the database's version of the text. Additionally, users may add their own products to the database to allow others to parse text that may not otherwise be included already.

This application has been published through Netlify along with using Heroku for the back-end.
### Challenges

This app is in no way a 'one size fits all' solution, however it is an attempt to demonstrate how one may approach the problem of creating a 'smart' title solution by creating a 'knowledge base' of known information of different products and matching the title provided by the user in order to parse it.
